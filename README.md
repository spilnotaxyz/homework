Post you solutions in a secret gist and send them to us.

## Tasks
1. TS Types Test: This is a git submodule with some TS Types questions. We want you to solve `00004-easy-pick`, `000016-medium-last` and `00114-hard-camelcase`
2. React Code Roast: Go to https://github.com/search?q=react&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc and choose any repository. Roast the shit out of the code! Code style abuse, typing issues, package choices, etc. Whatever makes you uncomfortable!
3. Solidity Code Roast: Go to https://github.com/search?q=solidity&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc and choose any repository. Roast the shit out of the code! Reentrancy issues, privelege escalations, no tests, not covered branches, bad tools choices, etc. Whatever makes you uncomfortable!

## Good luck!
